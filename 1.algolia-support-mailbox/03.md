Hi Julia,

Thanks for reaching out to us! Your instantSearch function isn't working because it's currently undefined. To correct this, let's modify your setup. Before your closing body tag in your HTML file, you should have these two script tags:

```
 <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/algoliasearch@3.32.1/dist/algoliasearchLite.js" integrity="sha256-pMaJf0I78weeXGkRMBDO6jSulxC/q3sb0aPdtV2N8n0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
 
 <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/instantsearch.js@3.2.0" integrity="sha256-/8usMtTwZ01jujD7KAZctG0UMk2S2NDNirGFVBbBZCM=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> 
```

Also, in your last script tag your search widgets are incorrectly configured. You must first create a searchClient using your Algolia Application ID and your Search Only API Key. Now you can access the instantsearch function. 

Next you must create a constant variable called search and set it equal to the instantseach function, which takes in two objects: 1. A key of 'indexName', which has a value of name of the index that you'd like to search, and 2. The searchClient. 

After this is set up, you can then add widgets to your search. Please refer to the steps in our InstantSearch.js installation guide, under the section "Directly in your page". https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/installation/js/  

Let us know if you have anymore questions!

Best,
