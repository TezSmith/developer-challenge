Hi Marc,

Thanks for reaching out to us. Searchkit is from the open source software, ElasticSearch which is not a part of Algolia's products. However if you'd like to create a lightining fast, beautiful search component with React, consider following our [React InstantSeach installation guide](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/installation/react/). 

Hope this helps!

Best,

Montez Smith
