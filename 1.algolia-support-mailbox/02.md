Hello,

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Thanks.

Hi Marissa,

I'm sorry to hear that you're not a fan of the new design, but thank you for your feedback! I'll be sure to pass it along. In the meantime, you can delete an entire index using the deleteIndex method in your site's code. For more information on the deleteIndex method usage and setup, check out this link: https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/delete-index/. 

If you'd like to clear objects out of your index, you can use the clearIndex method. This method takes a callback, so you can create the functionality you need to discard your unwanted objects. For more information on the clearIndex method visit https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/clear-objects/

Let me know it goes!

Best,

Montez Smith
