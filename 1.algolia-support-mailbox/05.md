Your notes and thoughts while answering:

Since today 9:15am we have been seeing a lot of errors on our website. Multiple users have reported that they were unable to publish their feedbacks and that an alert box with "Record is too big, please contact enterprise@algolia.com".

Our website is an imdb like website where users can post reviews of coffee shops online. Along with that we enrich every record with a lot of metadata that is not for search.

I am already a paying customer of your service, what else do you need to make your search work? Please advise on how to fix this.

Thanks.
