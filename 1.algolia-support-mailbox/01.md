I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:

- Records
- Indexing

I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."

Cheers, George

Hey George,

Welcome to Algolia, and thanks for reaching out to us! 

A record is an object you add to an index and want to search for. The records that your users are searching are the objects (Ex. list of books) that you send to our servers. For more information on records, check out this link: https://www.algolia.com/doc/faq/basics/what-is-a-record/. 

Indexing is the process that search engines use to add, update or delete data from their data stores (called an index). For more information on indexes and indexing, visit https://www.algolia.com/doc/faq/basics/what-is-an-index/ and https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/implementation-process/#indexing-data

Algolia's custom ranking allows you to show off your best products first. So to determine what metrics would be helpful to include your custom ranking, think of the attributes that best inform your customer's decision making like ratings or views.  Check out this article for more ideas: https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/must-do/custom-ranking/.

Hope this helps!
