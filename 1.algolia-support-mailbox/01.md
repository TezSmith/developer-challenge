Your notes and thoughts while answering:
---

I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:

- Records
- Indexing

I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."

Cheers, George
