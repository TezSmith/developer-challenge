Hi,

We have been trying to find some solution to our problem but could not in your documentation. Basically, on our music streaming services, we want logged in users to be able to search their playlist. But to search **only** their playlist.

We have a "playlist" index that looks like this:

```
[{
  "name": "Super playlist",
  "user_id": 234
}, {
  "name": "NYE playlist",
  "user_id": 345
}]
```

Right now we are able to use the "filter" option of Algolia but it's not super secure since any user can change the parameter and access every other user playlist. What can we do to ensure users are only able to search their own playlist and not all of them?

Thanks.

Hi Stan,

Thanks for reaching for out to us. You can protect your users by using Algolia's unretrievableAttributes parameter. The unretrievableAttributes parameter allows you to set a list of attributes that cannot be retrieved from a search. To implement this feature in your code, visit this link: https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-parameters/unretrievableAttributes/. 

You can also use the attributesToRetrieve with (or instead of unretrievableAttributes) to define which attributes can be retrived from a search. For more information on attributesToRetrieve, check out this link: https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-parameters/attributesToRetrieve/.

Hope this helps!

Best,
